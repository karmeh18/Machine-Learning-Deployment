Machine Learning Deployment with Streamlit

Here in this project, 3 Machine Learning Model are executed on 3 different datasets with the combination of Web Deployment with the assistance of Streamlit.
Streamlit is a very intuative library for the Web Deployment and is easy to execute and understandable
1. Brain Tumor
2. Bank Churner
3. HR Attrition

Above are the 3 datasets on which 3 different Machine Learning Algorithms are executed.


The major highlight of this Project is ML Function file where I have successfully created a function that only requires the data in the form of Independet Features and Dependent Feature and when executed in the function, The function asks about the execution to be carried forward on Raw Data or Transformed Data, if Transformations are accepted then the function asks about the tranformation techniques such as Standardization or Normalization if any of the one selected then the function asks for the Label Encoder and Dummy variable as it will detect the catagorical variables also. 
Lastly the function will detect the imbalance in Data and would suggest for Random Over Sampling and Random Under Sampling, furthermore the function also asks for the number of iterations for K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm and in the end it will return accuracies for 3 different algorithms.
